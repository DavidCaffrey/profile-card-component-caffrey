## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned about using SVG's as backgrounds and positioning them on the screen. This provided a good challenge to me as I discovered/tried various
techniques that didn't work well with the components before I discovered using the background CSS properties. I should have turned to the docs sooner.

### Continued development

To continue working with the Frontend Mentor challenges for the next month to build up knowledge and skills with CSS and HTML.
